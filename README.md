# react-component-playground

Here lies my space for building and testing components. Mostly from learned tutorials that I've modified. 

## Components
- `./components/MusicPlayer.jsx` - single file audio player with custom controls & visualizer

> [!note] uses NextJS framework for easy out of the box dev features.


## Audio Visualizer notes
- make each preset incorperate
  - bass reactive
  - mid/treble reactive
  - some swappable image attribute (user generated)
